## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

_your answer here_

If I had more time, I would have used a framework insted, solves a few set up issues and rest of html and css.
I would have like to place the small speech bubble arrow on the dropdowns, but that was taking longer then I wanted.
I would have like to have skeleton data showing for when the data is still fetching from the api.
I'd like to had a few animations

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I think I have all the requirments in place. can it looks more pretty yeah sure, but thats why you need UI designers as well lol.
However the first exercise was fustrasting because I would have just put class names in the divs.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

If the test would have a sketch of figma file with mobile and desktop desgins that would be nice.
