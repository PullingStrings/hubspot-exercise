## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

_your answer here_

Given more time, I would have used a framework to address setup issues and handle the HTML and CSS. Additionally, I wanted to add a small speech bubble arrow to the dropdowns, display skeleton data during API fetches, and incorporate animations.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I have all the requirements in place, though it could look more aesthetically pleasing with the help of UI designers. The first exercise was frustrating because I would have simply used class names in the divs.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

If the test would have a sketch of figma file with mobile and desktop desgins that would be nice.
